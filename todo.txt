[ ]  Architectural Pattern: Implement a solid architecture pattern like Model-View
-ViewModel (MVVM) or Model-View-Intent (MVI). Demonstrating a good separation of concerns in your codebase is key to show that you can create maintainable, testable, and scalable applications.

[ ]  Clean Code: The quality of your code matters. Follow a style guide consisten
tly, comment your code where necessary, and use meaningful variable/function names.

[ ]  Use of Latest Android Technologies and APIs: Prove your understanding of the
latest technologies. Implement Android's latest API features and libraries like
Jetpack Compose for UI, Coroutines or Flow for asynchronous programming, Hilt for dependency injection, etc.

[ ] Testing: Include unit tests, integration tests, and UI tests using libraries
like JUnit, Mockito, Espresso, and Robolectric. A well-tested app is a reliable app.

[ ]  Database and Storage: Implement a local database (like Room) for caching data.
 Demonstrate your knowledge of different storage options (Shared Preferences, Files, SQLite).

4. Security: Ensure your application follows security best practices, such as storing sensitive
 data securely (with Android Keystore, for instance), using network security
 measures (like SSL, certificate pinning), and obfuscating code.

6. Network Calls: Use libraries like Retrofit or Ktor for network operations and
demonstrate handling of network errors gracefully. Also, consider showcasing a sync strategy
for your app, dealing with online and offline modes.

7. Custom Views and Animations: Implementing some custom views or animations can
 be a great way to show off your deeper understanding of the Android UI toolkit.

8. Responsive Design: Ensure your app works across a variety of devices and scre
en sizes, including tablets. You could also include support for different orientations and multi-window mode.

9. Accessibility: Build your app with accessibility in mind. This includes provi
ding text for screen readers, handling different input methods, and considering color contrast, among other things.

10. Performance Optimization: Prove your knowledge of efficient programming prin
ciples, like efficient use of memory, battery-efficient programming, and smooth rendering.

12. Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD): Setup a CI/CD pipeline
 using tools like GitHub Actions, Bitrise, or Jenkins. It's a valuable skill for automating the build-test-deploy process.

13. Documentation: Write comprehensive README and code documentation. It should
explain the app's purpose, architecture, libraries used, how to run tests, and how to build and run the app.
